# grid-game

## Design Philosophy

This is to be a text-graphics game run in command line windows, on either linux or windows machines.
The game is essentially a basic rogue-like dungeon crawler, utilizing randomized encounters to populate dungeon floors.
- See the 'rules.pdf' for a pen&paper rulebook for an inspirational version of this game
- To be written in purely object oriented format

No further philosophy at this time, as this is mostly a learning experiment.

I would like to impliment some sort of end-game goal, however.
